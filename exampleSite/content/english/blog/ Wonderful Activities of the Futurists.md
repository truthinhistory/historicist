Futurism was introduced into the Protestant Church by Samuel R. Maitland, a clergyman of the Church of England, from Romanist writers, chiefly from the Jesuit Lacunza, about 1830. Lacunza was born in Chile in 1731 and died in Italy in 1801.
It spread with wonderful rapidity in England and from England to America. Note its present condition in this country.
As far as I can learn, all the Bible Schools in this country for the train­ing of Christian workers are Futurists. Their courses on Prophecy, studied by tens of thousands both by attendance and by correspondence, are based upon this error. For many years said Schools have sent out their graduates, who have never failed to indoctrinate all with whom they came in contact, and to fortify their minds against the Protestant interpretation of Prophecy.
With one possible exception, I know of no magazine on Prophecy that is not distinctly and avowedly committed to the Futurist Theory of interpreta­tion. Other religious magazines and papers, not strictly prophetic, have pub­lished thousands of articles that advocate Futurism in its various phases, so much so, that it is to be feared that said readers in tens of thousands of cases never so much as heard the true and Protestant application of the various prophecies.
The leading pastors of the principal Protestant denominations in our great cities, with rare exceptions, and many others who are pastors in village and country churches, are staunch advocates of this Futurist interpretation.
For the past half century or longer a veritable flood of Futurist notes in Bibles like C. I. Scofield's and Commentaries like James M. Gray's, thousands of books on prophetic teaching, pamphlets, magazines, tracts, papers, sermons, etc., etc., have gone out to deceive their readers in the assumed and imaginary fulfillments of Futurism.
As far as America is concerned, I am the only one to my knowledge that has raised even a feeble voice in protest against this truly formidable array of capital, of supposed learning and of persistent action.

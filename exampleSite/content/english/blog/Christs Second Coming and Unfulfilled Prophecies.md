A significant error, and the Scriptural responses to that error, are found below.
Some Preterists believe that although Christ did come at Pentecost (33 AD) and 70 AD, He will make a final appearance at the end of the world (age). Others strongly maintain that His second appearance was a spiritual one in 70 AD and that is the end of it.

Please note that the following Scriptures are very clear and not limited to one or two obscure verses that might easily be interpreted as one wished. The authors are of the highest caliber who were honest, godly men filled with the Holy Spirit â€“ Luke, John and Paul. Please read carefully and prayerfully.

Acts 1:10-11

> "And while they looked stedfastly toward heaven as he went up, behold, two men stood by them in white apparel; Which also said, Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven? this same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven."

Titus 2:13

> "Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ;"

2 Timothy 2:15-18

> "Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth. But shun profane and vain babblings: for they will increase unto more ungodliness. And their word will eat as doth a canker: of whom is Hymenaeus and Philetus; Who concerning the truth have erred, saying that the resurrection is past already; and overthrow the faith of some."

Paul wrote these words to Timothy in late 67 AD or early 68 AD. For those who believe that Christ returned at Pentecost (approximately 33 AD) and thus that the resurrection has occurred, Paul has laid their claims to rest. For those who believe He secretly returned at 70 AD, see Revelation 20:4-6 at the end of these passages.

John 14:3

> "And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto myself; that where I am, there ye may be also."

I John 3:2

> "Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is."
> Do we see Him as He is today? Are we like Him? No. . .

I Thessalonians 1:10

> "And to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead, even Jesus, which delivered us from the wrath to come."

I Thessalonians 4:13-17

> "But I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning them which are asleep, that ye sorrow not, even as others which have no hope. For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him. For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep. For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first: Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord."

It should be an obvious fact that Jesus' Second Coming and the resurrection of the righteous occur as one event. The resurrection is a result of His coming.

2 Peter 3:3-4

> "Knowing this first, that there shall come in the last days scoffers, walking after their own lusts, And saying, Where is the promise of his coming? for since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation.

Revelation 20:4-6

> "And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given unto them: and I saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus, and for the word of God, and which had not worshipped the beast, neither his image, neither had received his mark upon their foreheads, or in their hands; and they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years. But the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished. This is the first resurrection. Blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection: on such the second death hath no power, but they shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with him a thousand years".

2 Thessalonians 1:7-10

> "And to you who are troubled rest with us, when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels, In flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ: Who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power; When he shall come to be glorified in his saints, and to be admired in all them that believe (because our testimony among you was believed) in that day."

Has history ever recorded this awesome event?

Hebrews 9:27-28

> "And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment: So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation."

Philippians 3:20-21

> "For our conversation is in heaven; from whence also we look for the Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ: Who shall change our vile body, that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body, according to the working whereby he is able even to subdue all things unto himself."

Our bodies continue to age daily, they are not perfect; they are subject to decay (corruption); they become ill; they have not been fashioned like unto His glorious body because He has not yet returned, and we have not been resurrected or changed.

The Modernists, Rationalists and as Dr. Elliott, describes them, "those of the infidel school," are fond of spiritualizing the following verses from Luke, Chapter 1. Surely, no Christian would do so. However, just as absurd would be an attempt to read verses 30-31 literally yet spiritualize verses 32-33.

Luke 1:30-33

> "And the angel said unto her, Fear not, Mary: for thou hast found favour with God. And, behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and shalt call his name JESUS. He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest: and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David: And he shall reign over the house of Jacob for ever; and of his kingdom there shall be no end."

Again, it is a matter of timing. The Christ was conceived and brought forth. Now, we await His return, for God to give Him the throne of David, and for Him to reign over His Kingdom on earth as promised.

To you who have read these Scriptures pertaining to the Second coming of Christ, a question: "How readest thou?"

Historicists have been forced to the conclusion that those who can read these Scriptures and maintain they do not mean what they clearly state, but need changing, twisting, or spiritualizing, must have come to the Bible with preconceived conclusions and are desperately looking for Scriptures to hang them on.

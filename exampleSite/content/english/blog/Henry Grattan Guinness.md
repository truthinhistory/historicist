One of the gravest evils of futurism is the terrible way in which it tampers with this great fundamental prophecy (Daniel 9:27), applying to the future doings of some ideal Antichrist, its Divine description of the past deeds of the historic Christ.

He (Antichrist) co-exists not with a recognized Jewish nation, but with the rejection and dispersion of the Jews, and with a recognized professing Christian Church. His sphere is not Palestine, but Christendom; his throne is not Jerusalem but Rome; his victims are not Jews, but Christians.
